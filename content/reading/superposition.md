subtitle: "Holding multiple ideas at once"

I've always been drawn to the concept of superposition — the idea that something can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it's observed or measured.

In physics, a quantum particle can be in multiple states at once. In life, I think the most interesting people and ideas operate the same way.

You can be technical and creative. Analytical and intuitive. Serious and playful. The pressure to "pick a lane" is real, but I think the best work comes from refusing to collapse the wave function too early.

Some examples of productive superposition:

- **Builder and philosopher.** Build things with your hands. Think about why with your mind.
- **Specialist and generalist.** Go deep in one area. Stay curious about everything else.
- **Confident and humble.** Trust your abilities. Acknowledge your blind spots.
- **Patient and urgent.** Play long games. But act with intensity today.

The tension between these states isn't a bug. It's a feature.
