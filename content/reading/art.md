Art is the opposite of efficiency. It's the deliberate act of spending time on something that doesn't need to exist — and making it beautiful anyway.

I think everyone should make art, even if they never show it to anyone. The act of creating something — anything — changes how you see the world. You start noticing light, composition, rhythm, and texture in everyday life.

A few things I believe about art:

- The best art makes you feel something you didn't expect to feel.
- Constraints breed creativity. Give yourself fewer tools, not more.
- Taste is developed through exposure. Look at a lot of things. Read a lot of things. Listen to a lot of things.
- The gap between your taste and your skill is where growth happens.
- Art doesn't need to be explained. If it needs an explanation, the explanation is the art.

I don't think art and technology are at odds. Some of the most beautiful things I've seen were made with code. The medium doesn't matter. The intention does.
