Religion is one of the oldest technologies for making meaning. Whether you're a believer, a skeptic, or somewhere in between, the questions that religion asks are worth sitting with.

Why are we here? What happens when we die? How should we treat each other? What is sacred?

These aren't questions that science can fully answer — not because science is insufficient, but because they're not scientific questions. They're human questions.

A few things I find worth thinking about:

- Every major religion converges on some version of the Golden Rule. That's not a coincidence.
- Ritual and community serve psychological needs that modern secular life often fails to address.
- Doubt is not the opposite of faith. Certainty is.
- The most interesting conversations about religion happen between people who hold their beliefs openly and gently.

I'm interested in religion not as a set of answers, but as a set of questions. The questions themselves shape how we live, even if we never settle on final answers.
