Leadership is not about having all the answers. It's about asking the right questions and creating the space for others to find the answers.

The best leaders I've worked with share a common trait: they make the people around them better. Not through grand gestures, but through consistent small acts — listening deeply, giving honest feedback, and trusting their teams to figure things out.

A few principles I keep coming back to:

- **Context over control.** Give people the information they need to make good decisions, then let them make decisions.

- **Speed of trust.** Everything moves faster when people trust each other. Invest in building trust before you need it.

- **Disagree and commit.** Healthy debate is essential. But once a decision is made, align fully and execute.

- **Default to transparency.** Share more than you think you need to. Information asymmetry breeds dysfunction.

- **Celebrate the work, not the hero.** Great outcomes come from great teams, not great individuals.
